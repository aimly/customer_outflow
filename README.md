# CUSTOMER OUTFLOW

In any business sectors where a large amount of data that is suitable for analysis is collected, machine learning and data mining techniques are used. One of the most popular examples of using machine learning in real life is predicting customer churn. Predicting churn allows you to start retaining customers prone to churn in advance, thereby reducing the number of users who stop using campaign products. The purpose of this project is to build a customer churn model for the CRM department of the bank using the Python programming language. The resulting model is then used to identify a segment of users prone to churn, with whom targeted communications are then conducted in order to retain. The paper describes the process of building a model, starting with data collection and ending with the evaluation of the results obtained. Report is presented in russian and can be translated into english later.
